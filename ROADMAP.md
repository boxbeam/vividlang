- [ ] Associate AST elements with source location
  - Use `untwine::Spanned` or preferably an internal type
  - Can use `#[span]` in untwine to capture the span of a given chunk
  - Only idents and expressions should need it for now
- [ ] Implement better errors for type system
  - Add a way to translate constraint IDs into source locations
- [ ] Add generic registry
  - Step in compilation pipeline after type resolution
  - Functions which have unknown or non-concrete types in their signature will become generic
  - Non-concrete types that are NOT part of the function signature cannot be resolved
  - Monomorphize for each function using a HashMap of argument types to compiled function
